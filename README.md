## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Eigenvalues are a special set of scalars associated with a linear system of equations (i.e., a matrix equation) that are sometimes also known as characteristic roots, while eigenvectors are a special set of vectors associated with a linear system of equations that are sometimes also known as characteristic vectors

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors have a wide range of applications, for example in stability analysis, vibration analysis, atomic orbitals, facial recognition, and matrix diagonalization. 

Let there’s an _n_ × _m_ matrix can be considered as a function that uses matrix multiplication to take m-dimensional column vectors into _n_-dimensional column vectors. An _n_ × _m_ matrix is actually a linear function from _ℝ<sup>m</sup>_ to _ℝ<sup>n</sup>_. A square matrix A takes the set of n-dimensional vectors into itself, which gives a linear function from ℝn to ℝn. In this case, certain nonzero vectors **x** might be parallel to Ax, which means that a constant **λ** exists with _A_**x** = λ**x**. For these vectors, we have 
| _A_**x** = _λ_**x** |
<center>_A_**x** - _λ_**x** = 0</center>
<center>Ax - λI**x** = 0</center>
<center>(A – λI)x = 0</center>


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/handikao29/handikao29.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/handikao29/handikao29.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
